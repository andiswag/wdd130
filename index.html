        <p>Hello everyone. My name is Andiswa and I am from South Africa. I like to keep active by going to the gym or going for a run at a local park.<p></p>
     
        <p>I decided to enroll in this course as a way to challenge myself and I have developed an interest in technology. <br> I have enjoyed studying at BYU so far and I look forward to this module and others. 
        I'm currently working as an Admin Assistant<p></p>
    
        <p>I am looking forward to learning with you all!</p>
